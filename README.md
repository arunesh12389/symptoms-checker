# AI Symptom Checker

An intelligent web application that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide a structured, informational analysis of user-reported medical symptoms. The application features a modern, responsive interface and maintains a history of past queries.

## üß† About The Project

This project is a full-stack MERN application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) designed to serve as an AI-powered medical assistant. Users can input their symptoms, and the backend communicates with the **Groq LLaMA 3 AI** to generate a detailed analysis. The AI's response is structured into a JSON object, allowing the frontend to display the information in a clear, component-based layout, including a summary, potential conditions, and recommended next steps.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Integrates with the Groq API for fast, intelligent symptom analysis.
- **Structured Data:** The backend instructs the AI to return a predictable JSON object for easy frontend rendering.
- **Modern UI/UX:** A sleek, responsive dark theme built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Interactive Experience:** Users can click to add "refinement" symptoms to their query.
- **Query History:** All searches are saved to a MongoDB database and displayed in a history panel.
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Decoupled frontend and backend for maintainability and scalability.
